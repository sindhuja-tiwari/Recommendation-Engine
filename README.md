# Recommendation-Engine
🎬 ML Recommendation Engine
A production-ready recommendation system implementing multiple machine learning algorithms for personalized content delivery at scale.
🎯 Overview
This project demonstrates industry-standard recommendation techniques used by Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. It processes user-item interactions to generate highly personalized suggestions using collaborative filtering, content-based approaches, and hybrid methods.
✨ Features
Multiple Algorithms:

Collaborative Filtering - User-based and item-based similarity using Pearson correlation and cosine similarity
Content-Based Filtering - Genre and metadata analysis with TF-IDF weighting
Matrix Factorization (SVD) - Latent factor models for pattern discovery
Hybrid Approach - Weighted combination of all methods for superior accuracy

Production Capabilities:

Handles millions of users and items efficiently
Real-time recommendation generation
Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, Precision@K)
Cold start problem solutions
Scalable architecture with sparse matrices
